Scenario
You are opening a new theatre and need a system to manage the movies you plan to show. You want a script that allows you to:

Add Movies: Add movies to your theatre's collection.
Display Movies: List all movies currently in your collection.
Search Movies: Find movies by genre or director.
Project Requirements
Use const and let for variable declarations.
Create objects to represent movies.
Use functions to manage the movie collection.
Implement loops and conditional statements.
Include an if statement with an || condition.
Work with strings for movie details.
Export and import functions across multiple files.
Wrap all code blocks within try-catch statements for error handling.


Setup Your Project:

Create a new directory named theatre-movie-collection.
Inside this directory, create three files: index.js, movieCollection.js, and movie.js.

Create Movie Objects:

In movie.js, write a function createMovie(title, director, genre) that returns an object representing a movie.
Ensure the function is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle errors.

Manage the Movie Collection:

In movieCollection.js, create an empty array to store movie objects.
Write a function addMovie(movie) to add a movie to the collection.
Write a function displayMovies() to list all movies in the collection.
Write a function searchMovies(genre, director) to find movies by genre or director.
Use try-catch blocks in all functions for error handling.

Main Script:

In index.js, import the functions from movieCollection.js and movie.js.
Create a few movie objects and add them to the collection.
Display all movies.
Search for movies by genre or director and log the results.
Wrap the main logic in a try-catch block.
