(Easy) Task 1: Variables and Datatypes
Create variables to store your name, age, and whether you are a student (boolean).
Log these variables to the console.

(Easy)Task 2: Objects
Create an object person with properties: name, age, and address (which is another object with street and city).
Log the name and street properties to the console.

(Easy) Task 3: Arrays
Create an array with the following values: 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pear'.
Log the second and fourth elements of the array to the console.
Add a new fruit to the end of the array and log the updated array.

(Medium) Task 4: Loops and Functions
Create a function printNumbers that takes a number n and prints all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.
Inside the loop, if the number is divisible by 3, log "Fizz". If it is divisible by 5, log "Buzz". If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz". Otherwise, log the number itself.

(Medium) Task 5: Dynamic Arrays
Create an empty array called numbers.
Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 20. For each iteration:
If the current number is divisible by 2, add it to the numbers array.
Log the initial state of the numbers array to the console.
After the loop, log the final array to the console.

(Hard) Task 6: If Statements and Control Structures
Create a function findNumber that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should:
Loop through the array.
If the target number is found, log the index and exit the loop using break.
If the current number is divisible by 3, skip the current iteration using continue.
Log "Target not found" if the loop completes without finding the target.

(EXTREME) FINAL TASK (Bonus points): 
Create a function called printPattern that takes a single parameter n.
Use nested loops to print a pattern of stars (*) where each row has an increasing number of stars.
